# MCP MVP Implementation Status

This document provides a summary of the current implementation status of the MCP MVP project.

## Current Status (as of last update)

The project has implemented a fully functional MCP server with client libraries and multiple LLM integrations.

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Context-Based Tool Loading**
   - *Status: Complete* - The system now implements conditional tool loading based on detected context
   - *Behavior:* 
     - No context detected → No tools loaded
     - Context detected → Only relevant tools loaded
   - *Files*: `src/client/dynamicTools.ts`, `src/index.ts` (/tools endpoint)

2. **OpenAI Integration**
   - *Status: Complete* - Full support for OpenAI Assistants API with MCP tools
   - *Files*: `src/client/agents/assistant.ts`

3. **Claude Integration**
   - *Status: Complete* - Support for both AWS Bedrock and direct Anthropic API
   - *Files*: `src/anthropicClient.ts`, `src/index.ts` (chat endpoint)

4. **Web Interface**
   - *Status: Complete* - Simple web interface for interacting with models
   - *Files*: `src/web/index.html`

5. **MCP Tools**
   - *Status: Complete* - Various tools implemented:
     - Notes creation/retrieval
     - Jira integration (multiple tools)
   - *Files*: `src/index.ts`, `src/jiraTool.ts`

6. **Tool Metrics**
   - *Status: Complete* - Token usage tracking system
   - *Files*: `src/index.ts` (toolMetrics object)

## Recently Completed

- Implementation of fully context-based tool loading
- Updated documentation to reflect current behaviors
- Enhanced client-side context detection

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for the project:

1. Advanced context detection with more sophisticated NLP
2. Additional tool integrations
3. Enhanced frontend with conversation history visualization
4. Performance optimization for large-scale deployments

## Testing

All features can be tested through:

1. The web interface at `http://localhost:3333`
2. Direct API calls to the server endpoints
3. Running dedicated test scripts (`npm run test:*`)

For detailed implementation of each component, please refer to the respective documentation files.
