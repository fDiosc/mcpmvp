## Changes Implemented

1. **Created Documentation**:
   - Created `anthropic.md` with a comprehensive implementation plan
   - Updated `README.md` with new details about the Anthropic API integration
   - Updated `implementacao.md` with the latest project structure and features

2. **Added New Files**:
   - Created `src/anthropicClient.ts` with the Anthropic API client implementation
   - Created `src/jiraTool.ts` with expanded Jira tools implementation

3. **Updated Existing Files**:
   - Modified `src/index.ts` to support the new `anthropic` model option in chat endpoint
   - Added expanded Jira tools to `src/index.ts`
   - Updated `src/web/index.html` to include the new model option in the UI
   - Updated `package.json` to add the uuid dependency
   - Enhanced `src/anthropicClient.ts` with prompt caching functionality

4. **Implementation Details**:

   **Anthropic API Integration:**
   - Set up direct Anthropic API integration with proper error handling
   - Implemented proper tool use handling with correct message formatting
   - Added conversation history management for multi-turn interactions
   - Improved user experience with loading indicators and error reporting
   - Enhanced the message formatting function to handle various message structures and fix nested text issues
   - Fixed tool use handling by using the correct `id` field for tool_use blocks and `tool_use_id` for tool_result blocks
   - Added prompt caching support to reduce token costs for long conversations

   **Expanded Jira Tools:**
   - Implemented a comprehensive set of Jira API tools:
     - `get_jira_issue`: Basic issue information
     - `get_detailed_jira_issue`: Detailed issue information
     - `get_jira_issue_comments`: Issue comments
     - `get_jira_issue_transitions`: Available status transitions
     - `search_jira_issues`: JQL search capability
     - `get_jira_issue_watchers`: Issue watchers
     - `get_jira_issue_attachments`: Issue attachments
     - `get_jira_issue_sprints`: Associated sprints
   - Added proper schema validation for all tool inputs
   - Implemented robust error handling for API requests
   - Created test scripts to validate each tool's functionality

## Implementation Status

The implementation is complete with all critical issues addressed:

1. Fixed linting error in `src/index.ts` related to type checking in the Anthropic integration using type assertions.
2. Fixed the Anthropic API client type compatibility issues with the official SDK.
3. Updated the model ID to match a current valid Anthropic model (see model table below).
4. Enhanced message formatting to handle various message structures and prevent the "nested text" error in multi-turn conversations.
5. Fixed tool use ID field naming to match Anthropic API expectations, ensuring proper tool execution and acknowledgment in multi-turn conversations.
6. Successfully implemented and tested all expanded Jira tools with proper API integration.
7. Added prompt caching to reduce token costs for repeated content in conversations.

## Prompt Caching Implementation

The prompt caching functionality works by:

1. Adding cache control markers to appropriate parts of the conversation:
   - System instructions at the beginning
   - Prior conversation history
   - Keeping only the most recent user query uncached

2. Using the Anthropic beta API for prompt caching:
   - Added header: `"anthropic-beta": "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"`
   - Implemented with Claude 3.5 Haiku, which supports this feature

3. Tracking cache performance and token usage:
   - Added detailed logging of input/output tokens
   - Monitoring cache creation vs. cache read tokens
   - Calculating approximate cost savings

4. Benefits:
   - First API call creates the cache (25% more expensive than regular tokens)
   - Subsequent calls use the cache (90% cheaper than regular tokens)
   - Significantly reduces costs for multi-turn conversations
   - Cache automatically expires after 5 minutes of inactivity

   - Test complex scenarios with tool chaining between Jira and note creation
   - Monitor prompt caching effectiveness in various scenarios

2. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Add more robust error handling for API key issues
   - Implement better feedback for rate limiting or quota issues
   - Improve error messaging for Jira API failures

   - Implement streaming responses for a better user experience
   - Add token usage tracking and management
   - Implement additional Jira tools for issue creation and updates
